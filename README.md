# Generate TV Scripts
Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree `TV Script generation` project 

Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:

git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.
